Please review the GPU Grant Program website for full program details before submitting this form. All current updates to the program are posted there first. https://developer.nvidia.com/academic_gpu_seeding Professors, Researchers and Advisors should complete this online form to request a GPU for research purposes for themselves and/or their teams.In order to review your request, we require a statement of research summary and CV. Additional materials should not be used to attach a full proposal in lieu of a statement of research. Your statement of research must include the following:

- contact information

- a short description of your research project(s)

- how you and/or your team will use the GPU

- list of recent publications

GPU Grant Requests are reviewed and notification takes place on a bi-weekly basis.There is a limit of (1) GPU grant per person, per year.

We currently offer Jetson TX1/Jetson TX2 Developer Kit {if available in your region}, GeForce Titan Xp, and Quadro P5000 {if available in your region otherwise M5000}. We do not have a Tesla option - Tesla should not be selected in the drop down.

Students should not submit GPU Grant Requests. All submissions must come from a Professor, Researcher or Advisor. If you have multiple students interested in using GPUs for their research, one submission should be made for your group keeping in mind the overall goals for the next year. NVIDIA GPU grants are small "seeding" gifts intended to enable researchers to begin a new project and gain the preliminary results to support a larger proposal to other funding agencies. Our goal is "breadth-first" seeding and grants are for (1) GPU. Since NVIDIA does not make complete computer systems, we do not donate them. We also do not grant large quantities of equipment or server rack mountable GPUs. If you request more than one GPU for your research or your team, be sure to clearly explain why multiple GPUs are needed in your proposal. Check out our GPU Educators Program (https://developer.nvidia.com/educators) for details on educational resources.
